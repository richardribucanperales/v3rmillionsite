		<p class=paragraph>This site is to explain what I do and what you can do to help me out l0l. I made this entirely out of HTML and CSS, and it's being hosted by Github so thanks to them. Have fun here and report all bugs to the contacts down below. Currently, this site is going under extreme 'under the making' so yeah, don't be a buttboy and tell me the website looks crappy. I know. So I am a student at a school where it offers all these classes in computer science. I currently am getting my CISCO CCNA certification. I do have a certification in CISCO A+ IT essentials. I am taking Cyber Security with a little company called Junior Dev League, which my school pays for. I'm also taking coding with Junior Dev League. I'm a Senior, and I'm probably one of the nicest guys you'll meet because I'm a softie, but a fucking retard and an angry bitch at times. Please feel free to talk to me about anything. Don't solicit any illegal activity or money, threaten me, or do anything of that matter or this site will be taken down. Please. Thank you.</p>

			<p id=rrrroblox>Come play with me, I like playing/meeting new friends. I do milsim crap because It's interesting, I troll on The Streets, and I develop games. Builds ususally last a month and I barely build for people. You want me to build for you, I'll do it for super cheap.</p>
